# Frontend registration and major surfaces

## Frontend (`bb.app` entry)

`app.tsx` default-exports `definePluginApp` from `@get-bb/plugin-sdk/app`.
React and the SDK are **never bundled** — `bb plugin build` shims them to
the host's shared runtime, so the bundle only works inside bb.

```tsx
import {
  definePluginApp,
  useRpc,
  useRealtime,
  useRealtimeConnectionState,
  useSettings,
  useBbContext,
  useBbNavigate,
  experimental_FileLink as FileLink,
  UrlLink as UrlLink,
  useComposer,
} from "@get-bb/plugin-sdk/app";
import { toast } from "sonner"; // shimmed to the host toaster
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"; // vendored source YOU own
import { Dialog, DialogContent } from "@/components/ui/dialog";

export default definePluginApp((app) => {
  app.contentScripts.register({
    id: "editor-enhancement",
    mount({ pluginId, generation, signal }) {
      const onKeyDown = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
        // Ordinary trusted, same-origin DOM behavior.
      };
      document.addEventListener("keydown", onKeyDown, { signal });
      return () => document.removeEventListener("keydown", onKeyDown);
    },
  });

### A button in the thread header

A thread action with `placement: "header"` is a button in the open thread's
header instead of a menu entry. It shows after the workspace's Open button
with its `label` (several share one split button). On phones and in narrow
split panes it folds into the header's thread menu, as a row at the top. It
never appears in other menus, the quick-action picker, or
`experimental_useThreadActions`. Its `useData` receives only the threads
whose header is on screen. Return null from `item` whenever the button does
not apply. Header buttons do not show `choices`. bb's Git plugin registers
Commit this way.

```tsx
app.slots.experimental_threadAction({
  id: "deploy",
  title: "Deploy",
  icon: "Rocket",
  group: "deploy",
  placement: "header",
  useData: ({ threadIds }) => useDeployable(threadIds),
  item: ({ thread, data }) =>
    data.has(thread.id)
      ? { label: "Deploy", icon: "Rocket", run: () => openDeploy(thread.id) }
      : null,
});
```

`app.slots.experimental_threadHeaderAction` is retired: existing callers keep
rendering and `bb plugin build` warns. Use a header thread action instead.

### Rows and sections in the thread Info tab

`app.slots.experimental_threadInfoRow` adds a row to the Info tab's details
block; `app.slots.experimental_threadInfoSection` adds a section below it. bb's
own rows and sections are registrations of the same `{ id, group, order?,
component }` shape, drawn with the SDK's Info components (frontend-components.md).

```tsx
app.slots.experimental_threadInfoSection({ id: "automations", group: SECTION_GROUPS.related, order: 0, component: Automations });
function Automations({ threadId }: ExperimentalThreadInfoProps) {
  const items = useItems(threadId);
  if (items.length === 0) return null;
  return (
    <InfoSection label="Automations" count={items.length}>
      <InfoList items={items} getKey={(item) => item.id} limit={3}
        renderItem={(item) => <InfoListRow leading={<Glyph />} name={item.name} onSelect={...} />} />
    </InfoSection>
  );
}
```

Components receive `{ threadId, projectId, environment }` and mount once per
visible thread; `environment` is `{ id }` taken from the thread, null only when
the thread has no environment; read its state yourself. Return
null to show nothing. A row renders `experimental_DetailRow`.
Entries sort by `group`, then `order` within it (unset last), then registration
order, bb's first on a tie, as thread actions do. Join one of bb's groups from
`experimental_THREAD_INFO_ROW_GROUPS` or `experimental_THREAD_INFO_SECTION_GROUPS`
(bb's entries use orders 10, 20, 30 within a group), or name your own group to
sort it where its string falls. Inside a section slot `experimental_InfoSection` collapses and bb
remembers it per registration. A crash removes only that row or section.

### Context beside a thread's composer

`app.slots.experimental_threadContextSegment({ id, title, group, order?, summary, action?, details?, useVisible? })`
adds a segment to the context row above an open thread's composer; bb's parent
thread and the Git plugin's changed files use it too. `group`/`order` sort as for Info rows; bb's
groups are `experimental_THREAD_CONTEXT_SEGMENT_GROUPS`, and any other string
sorts in place (GitHub PR Status uses `"2_pullRequest"`). Each component mounts
in its own crash boundary: `summary` in the row, `action` at its end, `details`
below it. Props carry `threadId`, `projectId`, `environment` (null without a
usable environment), the visible `segments`
as `{ key, pluginId }` in row order (`key` is `<pluginId>/<id>`; bb's own use
`bb--core`), and `isExpanded`/`onToggle` (one segment is expanded at a time).
`useVisible(input)` false leaves it out. A segment whose content is also a
thread context card row or section hides itself while
`experimental_useThreadContextKind()` is `card`; see
frontend-thread-context-card.md.

### An action in every thread menu

`app.slots.experimental_threadAction` adds an entry to the thread header's
actions menu, the sidebar row's menu, its right-click menu, the compact
long-press drawer, and, when the user picks it in Customize actions, a
sidebar row's quick-action buttons. bb's own actions are registrations of the
same shape.

`useData` is a hook the host runs once for the whole app, never per row: read
your preferences or a realtime channel there. It receives `{ threadIds }`, the
sorted ids of every thread on screen or in an open menu; for per-thread state,
keep an id-keyed cache and fetch only the ids not in it, in one batch (for
example `useSdk().threads.experimental_listPluginMetadata({ threadIds })`).
`item` is pure: it gets `{ thread, data, sdk, navigate }` (your bound
`useSdk()` and `useBbNavigate()`) and returns the action for that thread, or
null to hide it. Menus and the quick-action picker sort registrations by
their static `group`, a separator between groups, then by `order`. Join one
of bb's groups through `experimental_THREAD_ACTION_GROUPS` (`open`, `state`,
`organize`, `settings`, `lifecycle`) or name your own. Within a group, give an
action with `choices` a higher `order` than plain actions so items that open a
submenu sit last. `choices` renders as a submenu, a drawer step with Back, or
a popover; the picked id reaches `run` as `value`. Set `detail` to the
current value: it shows on a muted line under the label, except on rows with
`choices`, where only tooltips and screen readers include it. Set
`choices.hint` for a footnote below the choices.

```tsx
app.slots.experimental_threadAction({
  id: "notifications",
  title: "Notifications",
  icon: "Notification",
  group: experimental_THREAD_ACTION_GROUPS.state,
  useData: ({ threadIds }) => useNotificationLevels(threadIds),
  item: ({ thread, data, sdk }) => ({
    label: "Notifications",
    detail: data.get(thread.id) === "muted" ? "Muted" : "All activity",
    icon: "Notification",
    choices: {
      items: [
        {
          id: "all",
          label: "All activity",
          selected: data.get(thread.id) === "all",
        },
        {
          id: "muted",
          label: "Muted",
          selected: data.get(thread.id) === "muted",
        },
      ],
    },
    run: ({ value }) => saveLevel(sdk, thread.id, value),
  }),
});
```

A replacement thread list renders bb's menus with
`experimental_ThreadActionsMenu` and `experimental_ThreadActionsContextMenu`,
passing its own rename editor as `requestRename` and list-only entries as
`inline` (`{ key, group, action }`). `trigger` is a function: spread the props
and ref it receives onto your button, or the menu never opens. `experimental_useThreadActions(thread, { keys })` returns bound
actions for quick-action buttons, and
`experimental_useThreadActionRegistrations()` lists every action's static
title and icon for a picker. Keys are `bb--core/<id>` and `<pluginId>/<id>`.

### A control in the Browser toolbar

`app.slots.experimental_browserToolbarAction` renders a component beside the
address bar of every built-in Browser tab. The component receives the owning
`threadId`, current `tabId`, top-level `url`, and `isCompactViewport` state.
Use these host-provided values to scope actions to the visible tab; do not infer
the active Browser from global state.

```tsx
app.slots.experimental_browserToolbarAction({
  id: "annotate",
  title: "Annotate page",
  component: ({ threadId, tabId, url, isCompactViewport }) => { ... },
});
```

Render a compact toolbar control and move larger UI into a host-owned panel or
portalled popover. `title` names the host wrapper; icon-only controls still need
their own accessible name. A component instance belongs to one Browser tab and
must release tab-scoped resources when it unmounts.

`experimental_page` scripts the tab's top-level document in the desktop app and
is `null` elsewhere. It does not take a CDP control lease, so no control banner
appears and agent automation can keep its debugger.

```tsx
component: ({ experimental_page: page }) => {
  useEffect(() => page?.onMessage((data) => console.log(data)), [page]);
  const pick = () =>
    page?.evaluate(
      "(document.addEventListener('click', (e) => bb.postMessage(e.target.tagName), { once: true }), true)",
    );
  ...
}
```

`evaluate(expression, { world })` awaits the expression and resolves its
JSON-cloned value. The default `isolated` world shares the DOM but not page
globals and binds `bb.postMessage(data)`; `onMessage` receives those values for
this plugin and tab. `world: "main"` runs beside page scripts (for example to
read framework state on DOM nodes) and binds `bb` to `null`. Anything installed
is lost when the document navigates; check again when `url` changes.

### Sidebar navigation and header

Drawing the sidebar navigation (`experimental_sidebarNavigation`) and its
controls beside the sidebar toggle (`headerComponent`) are covered in
frontend-sidebar-navigation.md.

### Replacing the sidebar thread list

Read references/frontend-thread-list.md for replacement list registration, rows, status glyphs and keyboard contracts.

## Tab API migration

See [the unified tab contract and migration examples](frontend-core-slots.md#tab-api-migration)
for replacing legacy registrations while preserving published bundles and saved tabs.

### Project folder editor

`experimental_useProjectEditor()` returns a stable `(projectId: string) => void`
callback that opens the host's Edit project dialog. It shows source folders,
their full paths and owning machines, with Add folder and Detach controls, and
lets the user rename the project. Personal is ignored. The core project menu,
core thread action and built-in thread-list project's menus use this same path.
Folder changes save immediately through the existing project source SDK APIs;
Save name saves the name separately.

The frontend test harness records opened project IDs in
`RenderedSlotInspectionState.experimental_projectEditorCalls`.
