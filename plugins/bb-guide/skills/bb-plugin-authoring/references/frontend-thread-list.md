# Replacing the sidebar thread list

`app.slots.experimental_threadList` is the one **exclusive** slot: only one
list fills the sidebar's scroll area. Registering activates the replacement
while the plugin is enabled. If multiple plugins register one, the first in
deterministic slot order is active by default; removing it reveals the next.
The user can pin a specific provider under **Settings → Appearance →
Sidebar**. The choice is per client. bb ships its own list as the bundled
`thread-list` plugin; there is no separate built-in list.

Your component gets the scrolling list and nothing else. The New-thread button,
the navigation, and the footer stay host-rendered —
other plugins live in two of those, so a replaced list must not remove them.
Put your own controls at the top of your scroll area instead.

If no thread list plugin is enabled, bb shows a placeholder that links to
Plugins. If the active component throws, bb shows a "stopped working"
placeholder with a Reload button plus one toast; nothing else in the sidebar
is affected.

The component receives:

```ts
interface PluginThreadListProps {
  activeThreadId: string | null;
  activeProjectId: string | null;
  isCompactViewport: boolean;
  /** Closes the mobile drawer. Always call it after opening a thread. */
  onNavigate: () => void;
  /** Deprecated compatibility value for the removed sidebar search field.
      The host always supplies "". */
  searchQuery: string;
}
```

**Reading and acting on threads.** One hook reads the list; writes go through
the plugin SDK and navigation:

```tsx
const { status, threads, projects, sections } =
  experimental_useSidebarThreads();
const navigate = useBbNavigate();
navigate.toThread(thread.id, { split: true });
navigate.toCompose({ projectId, placement: { sectionId, pinned: false } });
const archiveEnvironmentThreads = experimental_useArchiveEnvironmentThreads();

// sections: PluginSidebarSection[] — { id, name, createdAt, updatedAt } in
// server order. A thread's `sectionId` names one of these or is null for the
// loose "Threads" bucket. Create, rename, and delete sections and move
// threads between them through the public API client; the sidebar refreshes
// over realtime:
const sdk = useSdk();
await sdk.threadSections.create({ name: "Later" });
await sdk.threads.update({ id: thread.id, sectionId });

// threads: PluginSidebarThread[] — id, projectId, href (put it on the row's
// anchor; the host routes clicks in place), title, titleFallback,
// displayTitle, parentThreadId, parentNotifications ("auto" | "stuck" | "off"),
// lifecycleOwnerThreadId, sourceThreadId, sectionId,
// originKind, originPluginId, providerId, status (execution status; busy
// threads sort first in bb's list), runtimeStatus (status refined by host
// readiness), queuedWork ("none" | "waiting" | "failed"), hasPendingInteraction,
// activity, isUnread/isPinned/pinnedAt/isArchived/archivedAt, pinSortKey
// (manual pin order),
// isHidden (bb's list filters these out; the array keeps them),
// environment { id, name, branchName, path, isWorktree, providerId,
// workspaceDisplayKind }, where workspaceDisplayKind is deprecated
// compatibility data; host { id, name }, createdAt, updatedAt, lastReadAt,
// latestAttentionAt, and `indicator` (bb's resolved status kind) +
// `indicatorLabel` (its a11y string). Draw your own glyph for `indicator`;
// the SDK ships no status component. Treat an unknown indicator, status, or
// runtimeStatus value as its documented fallback — bb adds kinds over time.

// Three more per-row facts are client-local, so they are hooks rather than
// fields on the thread: an unsent composer draft (bb paints a pencil, or a
// "working-draft" glyph when the thread is busy), a row status another
// plugin's app-wide script set (bb draws it in place of the draft glyph), and
// the jump shortcut bb assigns while the app command modifier is held (bb
// shows a key pill). Compose them with `indicator` yourself:
const { hasUnsubmittedDraft } = useSidebarThreadDraft(thread.id);
const rowStatus = useSidebarThreadRowStatus(thread.id); // { icon, label, tone? } | null
const shortcut = useSidebarThreadShortcut(thread.id); // { label, ariaKeyshortcuts } | null
const draftIds = useSidebarThreadDraftIds(); // ReadonlySet<string>, for group rollups
const rowStatuses = useSidebarThreadRowStatuses(); // ReadonlyMap, for group rollups
const splitLayout = useSidebarSplitLayout(); // { panes: [{ paneId, rect, threadId, isFocused }] } | null
// projects: PluginSidebarProject[] — { id, name, isPersonal, href, settingsHref }

// Titles can contain @project:, @section:, and @thread: mentions. `displayTitle`
// is the resolved plain text (sort on it, use it for aria-label); <ThreadTitle>
// renders the same text with bb's mention chips:
<span className="truncate">
  <ThreadTitle threadId={thread.id} />
</span>;

// `environment.providerId` names an entry in bb's environment provider
// catalog; resolve it for a display name, and draw it with
// <experimental_ProviderIcon providerKind="environment" provider={entry} />:
const { providers: environmentProviders } = useEnvironmentProviders();

// Pull requests: read the GitHub PR Status plugin by thread.environment?.id
// (references/frontend-pull-requests.md).

const navigate = useBbNavigate();
const sdk = useSdk();
navigate.toThread(id, { split: true }); // bb's split placement rules
navigate.toCompose({ projectId, focusPrompt: true });
navigate.toCompose({ projectId, placement: { sectionId, pinned: false } }); // file it under a section
navigate.toCompose({ projectId, environmentId }); // reuse an environment
await sdk.threads.pin({ threadId: id }); // optimistic in bb's surfaces
await sdk.threads.markUnread({ threadId: id });
await sdk.threads.update({ threadId: id, title: "New title" }); // silent; for inline editing
```

Archive and delete go through bb's thread menu (below), which owns the
confirmations: archiving a thread with children asks first and counts them,
and deletion always asks.

Unit-test a list with `renderSlot(...)` from `@get-bb/plugin-sdk/testing/app`:
seed rows with the `sidebarThreads` option (plus `sidebarDraftThreadIds`,
`sidebarRowStatuses`, and `sidebarShortcuts` for the per-row hooks) and assert against
`inspection.navigateCalls` and `inspection.sdkCalls`.

**Pull requests on a row.** Read them from the bundled GitHub PR Status
plugin; see references/frontend-pull-requests.md.

**Splits.** Rows can drag out to the split area:

```tsx
const { splitProps, isAvailable, layout } =
  experimental_useSidebarThreadSplit(thread.id);

<a {...splitProps} onClick={...}>
  {title}
  {/* layout is data: draw a mini-map, a tint, or nothing */}
</a>;
```

The host owns the gesture rules, including the one that matters if your list
has its own drag-to-reorder: a split drag engages only once the pointer leaves
the sidebar.

**bb's menu on your row.** Render `experimental_ThreadActionsMenu` and
`experimental_ThreadActionsContextMenu` around your row for bb's own thread
menu (archive and delete confirmation included) plus every plugin's thread
actions; see "An action in every thread menu".
For multi-row selections (`experimental_bulkItem`), see frontend-sidebar-navigation.md.
`experimental_useArchiveEnvironmentThreads()` archives a whole environment
group with bb's pane cleanup and Undo toast.

**bb's status glyph on your row.** Pass the row's thread, its hidden children,
its draft, and `useSidebarThreadRowStatus(threadId)` to
`experimental_resolveThreadStatus` (bb's lists use the same function), then
render `experimental_ThreadStatusGlyph` with the result's `indicator` and
`rowStatus`; `label` and `isWorking` cover anything else you draw.

**Keyboard support is a DOM contract.** bb's thread shortcuts find rows by
query selector, not by React state. Put both attributes on each row's anchor or
the surface-specific numbered shortcuts, `thread.next`, and `thread.previous`
silently stop working:

```tsx
<a data-sidebar-thread-shortcut-target="" data-sidebar-thread-id={thread.id}>
```
